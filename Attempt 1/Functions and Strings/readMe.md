# Functions and Strings

---

This project contains practice exercises focused on implementing various functions and Strings using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## How to use this project

- Navigate to the project directory.
- In order to run this file, get Node installed.
- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Implement the functions for each practice problem as specified in the source files.
- Test your implementations by running the provided test cases.
- Repeat the process for each practice problem until all problems are solved.

### Practice Problems

Q1. [Reverse given Array. reverseArray(arr)
I/P : [1,3,5,2,6] O/P : [6,2,5,3,1]](#)

1. **Describe the function:** Create JavaScript function named `reverseArray.js` that takes an array as input.
2. **Intialise Variable:** Inside a function intialise a array to store values.
3. **looping:** Inside the function, a loop iterates over the input array starting from the last element and moving towards the first..
4. **Store values:** During each iteration of the loop, the current element of the input array is pushed into a new array in reverse order.
5. **Returned Value:** Once the loop completes, the function returns the new array containing the reversed elements.

Q2. [Given an array, return k largest elements in the array. kLargest(arri, k) : array](#)
[I/P: arri = [93, 17, 56, 91,98, 33, 9, 38, 55, 78, 29, 81, 60] k=3 ,
O/P: arro = [91,93,98]](#)

1. **Describe Function:** Create a JavaScript Function named `largestElement.js` which takes array and int as parameters.
2. **Intialise Variable:** Inside the function intialise a boolean value to false.
3.
