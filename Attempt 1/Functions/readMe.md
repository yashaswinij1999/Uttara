# Controls and Functions

---

This project contains practice exercises focused on implementing various controls and functions using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## How to use this project

- Navigate to the project directory.
- In order to run this file, get **Node** installed.
- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Implement the functions for each practice problem as specified in the source files.
- Test your implementations by running the provided test cases.
- Repeat the process for each practice problem until all problems are solved.

Q1. [Check whether given number ‘x’ is Prime or not. isPrime(x) : bool
Eg: x=0 false, x=25 false, x=91 false, x=67 true ](#)

> - create function name `isPrime`
> - if x equals to zero or one return false.
> - if x equals to 2 || 3|| 5 || 7 return true.
> - if x is divisble by 2 return false.
> - check if the number is divisble by odd numbers in a for loop incrementing the `i` by 2.
